**I like to use R to explore data that interests me. These interests include:** 

🎸 Wonky indie-pop music | 🏏 Test Match cricket | 🖋️ Cryptic crosswords | 🎧 True-crime podcasts

In April 2019 [I was awarded ‘Best Design’](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/04/05/first-shiny-contest-winners/) in RStudio’s inaugural Shiny Contest for [an app exploring the lyrics to the album ‘69 Love Songs’](https://committedtotape.shinyapps.io/sixtyninelovesongs/) by The Magnetic Fields.

**If you are looking for the niche intersection of Data Visualisation and 90s Indie music you have come to the right place.**
